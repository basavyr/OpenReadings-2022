This document presents how your thesis should be prepared for publishing. The abstract cannot exceed one A4 page. The size of the margins should be chosen as follows: top, bottom, left and right -- 20mm.

The format to be used is as follows: (i) the abstract title (Roman font, Bold, 14pt, All Caps, Centered) should be no more than 3 rows in length (centered); no empty line after the title; (ii) the authors’ names (Roman font, Normal, 12pt, Centered) should be listed as shown in the above example, with the presenting author’s name underlined; please write unabbreviated names; empty 10pt line break after the author list; (iii) author affiliations (Roman font, Normal, 10pt, Centered), indicated using numerical superscripts; (iv) email address of the presenter.

The body text of the abstract (Roman font, 10pt) should be both left- and right-justified. The first line of each paragraph should be indented by 0.75 cm, except of the figure caption and references. Do not add spaces/empty lines between paragraphs. The references \cite{key-1} are cited in the text in the order they appear. The reference list should use the format shown below.

Do not use fonts, smaller than 7 pt in figures (for example Fig.~\ref{fig:Example_figure}), graphs and tables or anywhere else in the document. All abbreviations should be fully introduced at their first appearance in the text.

oscillator.}
\end{figure}
Numbered equations are placed on a separate line and centered. The mathematical symbols are typeset in standard notation: functions and variables in italic, standard functions ($\sin$, $\exp$, ...), mathematical constants ($\mathrm{e}=2.71828...$; $\mathrm{i}^2=-1$; etc.), differential and other symbols in a regular (upright) mode. When referring to the equations in the text, enclose their numbers in parentheses, e.~g., Eq.~(\ref{eq:Maxwell}):

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{rot}\:\mathrm{rot}\:\hat{E}(\vec{r},t)+\left(\frac{\imath}{c}\right)^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\hat{E}(\vec{r},t)=-\frac{4\pi}{c}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\hat{P}(\vec{r},t).\label{eq:Maxwell}
\end{equation}
Write the link to the references in angular brackets \cite{key-1}. The list of the references should be written in 8 pt. Times New Roman font. 

The abstract book will be printed in greyscale (color online). Please consider it when preparing the figures to avoid ambiguities in greyscale-printed book. The quality of photos should be at least 150 dpi.
