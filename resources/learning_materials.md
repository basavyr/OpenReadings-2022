  - Paper by Budaca in which the wobbling energies for the odd-mass $^{135}$Pr and the even-mass $^{134}$Pd are compared with the experimental data available.

    - The experimental results for the odd-mass $^{133}$La are presented, with identification of a one-phonon wobbling band built on on top of the $n_w=0$ yrast band in this nucleus. The wobbling motion is considered to have a **longitudinal** character.
