1. ![budaca](2022-01-09-11-16-18.png)

   - Paper by Budaca in which the wobbling energies for the odd-mass $^{135}$Pr and the even-mass $^{134}$Pd are compared with the experimental data available.

2. ![timar](2022-01-09-11-18-37.png)

   - The experimental results for $^{105}$Pd are discussed in terms of wobbling excitations.

3. ![biswas](2022-01-09-11-25-13.png)

   - The experimental results for the odd-mass $^{133}$La are presented, with identification of a one-phonon wobbling band built on on top of the $n_w=0$ yrast band in this nucleus. The wobbling motion is considered to have a **longitudinal** character.

   - The wobbling structure of $^{183}$Au is discussed in terms of the wobbling bands that are identified within the rotational spectra of the nucleus.

   - The formulas used in the research are presented in the following paper.

6. ![chen](2022-01-09-11-47-30.png)

   - Discussion of the first example of even-even wobbling nucleus. The wobbling excitations are built on a two-quasiparticle wobbling band.
