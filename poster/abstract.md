INFLUENCE OF THE MOMENTS OF INERTIA ON THE SHAPE AND DYNAMIC OF A TRIAXIAL NUCLEUS

## Abstract

The energy spectra of rapidly rotating nuclei have specific rotational spectra, parametrized in terms of some empirical constants called moments of inertia (MOI), in correspondence to the energy levels of a rigid rotating top. In this work, a quantitative description of the moments of inertia (e.g, kinematic, dynamic) is made, by using different formulas for their calculation. A comparison between the moments of inertia specific to the rigid case and irrotational one is also shown for a set of deformation parameters specific for the triaxial shapes (i.e., $\beta$, $\gamma$). Moreover, the connection between the wobbling motion, namely the wobbling frequency, the rotational frequency, and the three MOIs is analyzed for a specific excited spectrum of odd-mass nuclei. The different modes of rotation for the deformed rigid bodies are also specified in terms of these quantities. As a final goal, the theoretical MOIs of several odd-$A$ nuclei are compared to the experimental values using the $ab$ formula.
